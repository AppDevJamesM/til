title: Three things I learned from The Ruby Koans
---

Here are (at least) three things I learned from [The Ruby Koans](http://rubykoans.com/):

1) When curly brackets are used next to a method name without parentheses separating the two Ruby interprets it as a block rather than a hash, allowing the block operation to be written on one line.
2) Using self to define class methods allows them to be inherited by other classes, as opposed to defining them with class names.
3) Using the splat operator in front of a variable when defining methods allows for a variable number of arguments.
